# Project Audit Recommendations

## Overall Evaluation
Based on Slither’s detain scan and our analysis, there are areas for improvement to enhance security and gas efficiency. 

## Top 3 Priority Issues

1. **Unchecked External Calls** - Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in the ProposalVoting contract:
   - This vulnerability can lead to potential reentrancy attacks and unauthorized operations. The impact of such attacks can be severe, leading to loss of user funds or manipulation of contract state.
   - Priority: High
   - Mitigation: Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern and ensure proper validation of external call results. Estimated fix time: Medium.

2. **Integer Overflows/Underflows**:
   - Integer arithmetic vulnerabilities can result in unintended behavior, such as incorrect token balances or unexpected contract state changes.
   - Priority: Medium
   - Mitigation: Use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations and perform comprehensive testing to identify potential overflow/underflow scenarios. Estimated fix time: Low.

3. **Gas Inefficiencies**:
   - Gas inefficiencies can impact user experience by increasing transaction costs and hindering contract scalability.
   - Priority: Medium
   - Mitigation: Optimize contract logic, minimize storage usage, and reduce unnecessary computations. Consider gas-efficient alternatives for contract operations. Estimated fix time: High.

## Justification
- Unchecked External Calls: Reentrancy attacks are well-documented and while it usually leads to financial losses, for ClimateDAO these attacks lead to international chaos and potential earth destruction. Mitigating this vulnerability should be a top priority to secure the voting process.

- Integer Overflows/Underflows: While not as immediately exploitable as reentrancy attacks, integer arithmetic vulnerabilities can still cause substantial damage to the contract's integrity and user assets. Addressing this issue mitigates potential risks associated with incorrect contract behavior, like having countries hack contracts to manipulate voting.

- Gas Inefficiencies: Not directly related to security, but optimizing gas usage improves the overall performance and useability of the platform. While gas usage might not be of much importance to powerful countries on a world stage, gas directly relates to an impact on the environment, and considering the nature of the DAO, minimizing gas usage is of the utmost importance.

## Simple Recommendations 
-	Remove unused code to improve readability and reduce contract size.
-	Upgrade Solidity versions to ensure consistency and reliability – the current versions appear old and more vulnerable to problems.
-	Mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities in the ProposalVoting contract.
-	Optimize loops to avoid costly operations and improve contract efficiency.
-	Flesh out the Token Functionalities and more seriously test the interactions between contracts dynamically.
